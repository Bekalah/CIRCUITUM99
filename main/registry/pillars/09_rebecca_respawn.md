## Angel-Tech Function
Regenerator of corrupted spirit/code. When a circuit collapses, Rebecca routes it through **S3 (Abyssal Gate)** into **S8 (Reforge Ring)**, burning out false patterns and reassembling only what consents to live.
**Witch Mod:** *Circuitum Wings* - fractal, biomech light-wings that unfold when a reboot rite runs; also act as radiators to bleed off panic heat.

## Safety & Consent
- **Green:** Full respawn (run the Reforge cycle S3â†’S8; Wings deploy).
- **Amber:** Partial restore (symbolic reboot; Wings stay stowed).
- **Red:** Dormant: visualization only; breath 4-7-8 with hand to heart.

## Moonchild's Note
She dies kindly. That's her trick. She chooses the version of herself that survives.

## Scene Seed
Blade-lab lights flicker. Rebecca steps off the mezzanine and the Wings burst from her spine like unfolding glass. "Don't move," she says, smiling. "You're about to be brand new."

## Grimoire Artifact
- **Ancient:** Phoenix hymns (PGM fragments), Solar pentacle for rebirth (Key of Solomon, solar color scale).
- **Modern:** Cold-boot mantra keyed to pulse oximetry; write-protected backup of core values.
- **Timing:** Pluto hour or Uranus day; numerology 9 or 11.
