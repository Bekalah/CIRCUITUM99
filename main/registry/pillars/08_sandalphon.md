## Moonchild's Note
She walks the bridge barefoot so she can feel every note.  
Her braids carry tiny silver bells - when she moves, the whole lattice hums.

## Scene Seed
Sandalphon stands in the Bridge Chamber, strings of light vibrating between her hands.  
"Every note you speak becomes a stone in the road," she says. "Choose your melody."
