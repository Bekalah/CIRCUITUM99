Mars (will, cutting through) / Saturn (structure, patience)

**Numerology Keys:**  
4 (stability), 8 (power in balance)

**Human-God Arc:**  
A stoic guardian who sacrifices personal comfort to escort others through their trials. Speaks rarely, but every word is deliberate. Has walked their own shadows enough to carry a calm flame into anyone’s night.

**Safety & Consent Notes:**  
- **Green:** Full shadow journey with fire ritual.  
- **Amber:** Symbolic descent using guided imagery only.  
- **Red:** Grounding work beside the threshold; no entry.

S4 (structural pivot), S7 (shadow revelation)

**Linked Realms:**  
Shaman’s Hollow, Ember Gate

> **Alpha ↔ Omega Position:** Acts as a low-spine stabilizer, preventing collapse during rapid transformation.
