*Storm-Born Threshold Guardian*

## 🐎 Overview

Twin Lightning is the **Daimon of the Isle of Return** -- a luminous horse whose mane crackles with paired arcs of silver-violet fire.  
Its presence marks the moment of transition between holding grief and allowing it to be transformed.  
This daimon does not speak in words but through **thunder-pulse in the chest** and **lightning flashes across the inner eye**.
