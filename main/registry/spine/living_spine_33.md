# Living Spine -- Alpha et Omega (Verbatim Recovery)

Three acts × eleven stations. The spine is a living path; each station is a ritual scene with a book memory to reclaim. Station 21 belongs to Moonchild as the continuity lock; the axis crosses there when the reader accepts memory without erasing the wound.

Act I (1–11): initiation and pattern recognition. Act II (12–22): descent, retrieval, re-choice. Act III (23–33): integration and return. Some stations are partial; the book permits blanks until the body remembers.

The school (dark-academia) is the hub between stations; corridors are chapters that fork into the realms; the librarian is sometimes Moonchild, sometimes a mirror of the reader.

The spine tolerates non-linear traversal; the registry remembers the last truthful order and refuses false continuity when someone tries to force a sequence that didn’t happen.
