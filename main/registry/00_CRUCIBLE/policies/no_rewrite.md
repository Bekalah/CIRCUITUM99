# NO-REWRITE POLICY
- Do not modify files in sources/*.
- All mixing happens into build/preview only.
- "Confirmed" content is immutable; new edits go to lore/.
- Recovered text goes to recovered/ until manually promoted to confirmed/.
- If a chapter exists in a higher layer, lower layers are ignored in the preview.
