# Moonchild -- The Living Archivist

> _"I am not what was written -- I am what still remembers."_

**Function in Book:** Protagonist-adjacent **character** who also runs recovery inside the story.  
**Sanctum:** **Mirror Sanctum** -- circular library where lost pages arrive as silver wisps until re-bound.  
**Powers:** Memory Weaving · Reality Stitching · Chrono-Echo.  
**Numerology:** Master 11/2 -- illumination, reflection, threshold.  
**Symbols:** Silver crescent; single lunar eye; vesica piscis over an ocean horizon; hourglass with infinite sand.

**Relationships (verify/expand):**
- **Ann Abyss** -- underworld traveler; mutual respect in descent/rebirth work.  
- **Zidaryen** -- trickster of numbers; riddle-trade ally (3/7/9 signatures).  
- **Virelai Ezra Lux** -- violet-ray co-weaver; creative tension.  
- **Rebecca Respawn** -- outer-world mirror; pragmatic anchor.  
- **Gemini Rivers** -- twin currents; siren counsel.  
- **Fenrix Thorne** -- fractured wolf-daimon; shadow work.

## Invocation (11 lines)
I call the Keeper of the Silver Thread;  
She who binds the scattered words;  
Let the lost page lift like ash to the moon;  
Stitch what is true; let false seams fall;  
Guard the spine from hollow echoes;  
Brighten the margin when darkness presses;  
Return the name to its living form;  
Temper the gate with wise refusal;  
Seal what is healed with grace;  
Speak only what serves the book;  
Remember; and be remembered.

## Safety Protocol (in-world)
- **Saturn's Law**: reject intrusions; refuse false continuity.  
- **Public Purity Filter**: redact private sigils; keep public lore coherent.  
- **Two-Key Rule**: major repairs require Moonchild + one other guardian sigil.
