**Next Steps**
- Add missing archetypes like White Rabbit, Quan Yin, and Raku Fire Dragon as their own numbered files.
- When you add new summaries, update this `_index.md` immediately so the registry stays in sync.
- Link `_index.md` here to `registry/02_grimoire/grimoire_index.md` so the master registry pulls it.
