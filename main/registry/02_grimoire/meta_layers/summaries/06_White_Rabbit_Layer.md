# White Rabbit Layer

## Summary
The White Rabbit archetype serves as a **threshold guide** -- a figure who disrupts ordinary perception and draws the seeker across a liminal boundary into deeper reality. Historically rooted in Lewis Carroll's *Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland*, the White Rabbit functions as an initiator in the Fool’s Journey: not a teacher, but a catalyst who forces the protagonist to choose between comfort and awakening.

In folklore and mystery traditions, rabbit figures often represent **speed, intuition, and timing**. The "late" rabbit is paradoxically right on time for the soul’s unfolding. Within *The Book of Abyssia* meta-system, the White Rabbit acts as a **living key** to the Underworld trials and paradox riddles, closely aligned with the Fox Trickster and Scarlet Lady layers.

## Meta Layer Integration
- **Realm Alignment:** Liminal Gateways / SubTavers  
- **Element:** Air + Ether (for speed, thought, and perception shifts)  
- **Numerology:** Master Number 11 (initiation, insight, awakening)  
- **Aka Dua Frequency Tie:** Subtle interplay of White and Gold (illumination + timing precision)  
- **Folkloric Roots:** Celtic lunar hare myths, Slavic trickster spirits, Hermetic "Messenger" archetype

## Application in Book & Game
- Appears in **initiation sequences**, where players/readers are nudged toward making an irreversible choice.
- Provides **coded clues** rather than direct answers, pushing the seeker to notice synchronicities.
- Works as a bridge between **Fox Trickster riddles** and **Scarlet Lady transformations**.
