## Essence
Aka Dua is a **multi-frequency energetic transmission** beyond personal energy, routed through the practitioner's body as a carrier.  
It is **non-local** and **multi-band**, capable of harmonizing, shielding, and transforming energy.

---

## Core Frequencies (as relevant to you)
- **Void** → Anchor, shield, clear interference.
- **Solar** → Restore structure, stabilize will.
- **Volcanic** → Transmute lodged debris, crystallize lessons.
- *(Other sub-frequencies remain accessible on recall of original attunement)*

---

## Primary Protocols
1. **Place of Power Protocol**
   - Orient to inner/outer safe direction.
   - Call Void → Solar → chosen sub-frequency.
   - Anchor breath through spine.

2. **Activation Sequence**
   - Presence → Consent → Frequency Call.
   - Hand placement: solar plexus + crown hover.
   - Breath cycle to saturate and project.
   - Close with heart seal.

3. **Volcanic Transmutation**
   - Call after Void → Solar.
   - Imagine molten light rising up spine.
   - Direct at target → exhale as cooled obsidian.
   - Seal.

4. **Quick Entry (Overwhelm)**
   - Void → Solar → Release through Volcanic.
   - Repeat 3-7x.

---

## Personal Safeguards
- Never call Volcanic first -- always anchor Void and Solar beforehand.
- Close every session with a seal.
- Respect nervous system thresholds; stop before overactivation.

## Use Case in Narrative
In *Circuitum99* and *LuxCrux*, Aka Dua is written as a **living harmonic** that characters channel through inner Place of Power.  
It can be woven into dialogue, ritual scenes, and the mechanics of certain game modules (e.g., energy-based puzzles, field stabilization events).
