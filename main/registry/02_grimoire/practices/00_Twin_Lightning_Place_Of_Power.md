# Twin Lightning -- Place of Power

**Status:** Private / Personal Use Only  
**Daimon Name:** Twin Lightning  
**Form:** Horse with storm markings, twin lightning sigils  
**Origin:** [Private note: Insert your own memory here if desired]  
**Elemental Resonance:** Storm (Void + Solar + Volcanic)

---

## 1. Preparation
- Choose a space where you can remain uninterrupted.  
- Anchor yourself physically (bare feet or grounded stance).  
- Recall the specific *moment of knowing* Twin Lightning -- the body memory that tells you they are real.

---

## 2. Call
- Inhale sharply twice.  
- Internally speak: **"Twin Lightning -- ride the sky, carry my will."**  
- Wait for the sensation of ground-vibration or inner hooves.

---

## 3. Establish the Place of Power
- Visualize the plateau under storm clouds.  
- Pillars:
  - **North** - Silver stormcloud (Void)  
  - **East** - Golden dawn strike (Solar)  
  - **South** - Magma and rain (Volcanic)  
  - **West** - Dark rainpool (Water/Integration)  

---

## 4. Integration
- Feel Twin Lightning circle you, spiraling Aka Dua bands:
  1. Void -- stillness, depth.  
  2. Solar -- clarity, vitality.  
  3. Volcanic -- transmutation, release.

---

## 5. Transmutation (choose)
- **Cleansing:** Let volcanic heat rise as storm wind -- burn away and disperse.  
- **Charging:** Let lightning strike heart center -- fill with Solar fire.  
- **Shadow Integration:** Stand in the rain until Void + Solar + Volcanic hum together.

---

## 6. Seal
- Twin Lightning stops before you, you touch the lightning sigils on their neck.  
- Seal with intention (you choose the exact inner words).  
- Let the plateau fade but retain the twin bolts in aura for as long as needed.
