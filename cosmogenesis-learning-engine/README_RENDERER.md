# Cosmic Helix Renderer

Static HTML+Canvas renderer for the Circuitum 99 cosmology. Double‑click `index.html` to view a 1440×900 canvas composed of four calm layers:

1. **Vesica field** – intersecting circles grounding the space.
2. **Tree‑of‑Life scaffold** – 10 nodes and 22 paths, centered for balance.
3. **Fibonacci curve** – golden spiral polyline, drawn once for stability.
4. **Double‑helix lattice** – two phase‑shifted strands with 22 rungs.

## ND‑safe & Offline
- No animation, no motion loops, no external libraries.
- Colors come from `data/palette.json`; if missing, a fallback palette is used.
- Works by opening `index.html` directly in any modern browser.

## Numerology Constants
Geometry routines are parameterized by sacred numbers: 3, 7, 9, 11, 22, 33, 99, 144. Adjusting these values alters scale but keeps symbolic meaning.
