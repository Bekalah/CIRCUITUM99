# Cathedral of Circuits — Master Map

## 1. Architectural Core
- **Base:** Gothic cathedral inspired by Rosslyn.
- **Vault:** Crowley's Triangle of the Universe as supernal canopy.
- **Floor plan:** Equal-armed cross for the elements and worlds.
- **Spine:** 33 vertebrae aligning Qabalistic paths with Spiral Dynamics stages.
- **Atrium:** 21-petal rose marking Tarot Major checkpoints.
- **Helix Tower:** Double spiral of 72 angels and 72 daemons linked by cross bridges.
- **Ateliers:** Planetary chapels for museum-grade art-making.
- **Realms:** Garden, Dragon, Abyss, Sophia7, and Taverns as modular chambers.
- **Soyga Squares:** Letter and number lattices tessellating the crypt floor.

## 2. Lineages Continued
- **Agrippa:** Correspondence tables become Soyga grids and helix pairings.
- **Dion Fortune:** The inner temple becomes a walkable cathedral of realms.
- **Paul Foster Case:** Tarot and color codes inform the rose atrium and ateliers.
- **Frater Achad:** Remapped tree echoes in the DNA-like double helix.
- **Israel Regardie:** Magick-as-therapy inspires trauma-conscious design.
- **Timothy Leary:** The eight-circuit model maps onto the 33-spine ladder.
- **Robert Anton Wilson:** Reality tunnels appear as open-world realms.
- **Phil Hine:** Chaos remix ethos powers fusion ateliers.
- **Paul Levy:** Wetiko theory frames the cathedral as immune architecture.
- **Robert Falconer:** Structured angelic and daemonic engagements.
- **Iain McGilchrist:** Left–right hemisphere dialogue; cathedral bridges them.

## 3. Spiral-Harmonic System
- 33 spine nodes combine Qabalistic paths with Spiral Dynamics value memes.
- Rose window and helix tune to Fibonacci and planetary ratios.
- Each node hosts an evolving egregore; learning is spiral and non linear.

## 4. Brain Hemisphere Integration
- **Left hemisphere:** Ateliers, geometry, Soyga grids.
- **Right hemisphere:** Realms and rose, archetypal color harmonics.
- Cross links along the helix and rose atrium act as corpus callosum bridges.
- Right leads with holistic perception; left supports with precise analysis.

## 5. Research and Art Function
The cathedral acts as a research operating system:
1. Enter through a realm or tunnel.
2. Meet egregores at spiral nodes.
3. Fuse angelic and daemonic pairs at helix bridges.
4. Render the outcome as a codex plate in an atelier.
5. Archive the work back into the cathedral for iterative growth.

## 6. Purpose
- Continue the lineage of Agrippa through McGilchrist.
- Heal modern imbalance and trauma with ND-safe practices.
- Offer an open-world lab blending science, art, and magick.
- Fuse angelic/daemonic, Tarot/Qabalah, and Spiral Dynamics stages into new archetypes.
- Serve as cathedral, research framework, and art machine in one.
