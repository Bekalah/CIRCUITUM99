# Aka Dua Manual -- Operational Layer
_version: 1.0 • source: aka-dua-2.pdf (Koyote the Blind)_

## 0) What this layer is
A **non-fiction operational distillate** of the Aka Dua manual for direct practice and system integration. No fantasy dressing. Use this to:
- Practice the core current safely and cleanly.
- Reference technique blocks without rereading the manual.
- Plug into Circuitum99 (registry, codex, game hooks) without overwriting lore.

## 1) Summary (What, Why, How)
**Aka Dua** is presented as an **ancient energy current** preserved through **Toltec lineages** and iterated in modern practice. It’s framed as both **healing** and **developmental**: you use it to clear, align, and strengthen yourself and others, and to stabilize attention in the Dreaming (awake and asleep).

- **What it does:** Clears excess/noisy charge, builds coherent presence, enhances perception/attention, supports emotional & physical regulation.
- **Why it’s different:** The manual treats Aka Dua as a **multi-band vibrational current** (see § *Range of Aka Dua Vibrational Frequencies* in the manual). You work with it directly, not symbolically.
- **How it’s taught:** Three formal progressions (Transmission → Attunement → Mastery Initiation), plus a library of **techniques** (Place of Power, Draining, Eyes of the Dreamer, etc.) for solo and partnered work.

**Deliverables you can rely on in practice:**
- A daily base (Place of Power + Draining).
- Solo activation and circulation of the current.
- Partner work (sending, receiving, releasing excess cleanly).
- Boundaries and exit procedures (close, ground, normalize).

## 2) Lineage & Frame (condensed)
- **Historical capsule:** The manual traces threads to **Ce Acatl (Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl)**, Toltec exilic transmission, and the culture-wars against **Tezcatlipoca** currents (sorcery/"practical power"). It also references a **Sro/Atlantis** narrative (see manual § *Aka Dua, the Sro, and Tales of Atlantis*). Use this as *context*, not dogma.
- **Modern stance:** "Techniques are simple, very powerful." You’re encouraged to practice, compare notes, and avoid guru-ification. Aka Dua is framed as **more than healing**--a current that enhances multiple facets of personal, professional, and spiritual life.

_Use_: Keep the lineage as **appendix** in your Codex. In gameplay, reference as "whispered provenance," not exposition.

## 3) Levels (progression without hype)

### Level One -- **Transmission**
- **Goal:** Connect you to the current; teach you to feel and move it **within your own body**.
- **Milestones:** Recognize somatic signatures (heat, tingling, luminous pressure), trace pathways, basic self-regulation using the current.

### Level Two -- **Attunement**
- **Goal:** Strengthen channel stability; **send** Aka Dua to others; **receive** cleanly; **release excess** (important).
- **Milestones:** Partner work without sympathetic overload; clear send/receive protocol; clean shutdown.

### Level Three -- **Mastery Initiation**
- **Goal:** _Leadership of practice_ (not authority cosplay): support others’ practice, hold group fields, introduce nuance (sub-bands), and tailor applications responsibly.
- **Milestones:** Repeatable outcomes with varied recipients; adaptive pacing; structured debriefs; ethics under load.

## 4) Core Techniques (verbatim-aligned)
_(Headings mirror the manual so you can cross-check quickly.)_

### 4.1 Creating a Base for Practice -- **Your Place of Power**
- **Purpose:** A personally anchored practice space (physical or imaginal) to stabilize perception and energy.
- **Minimum viable protocol:** Enter → orient to 3 anchors (visual, auditory, somatic) → breath consistency → intent ("practice begins") → exit ritual ("practice ends").
- **Use daily** before any other technique.

### 4.2 **The Draining Exercise**
- **Purpose:** Discharge agitated/foreign/static charge safely.
- **Procedure:** Stance → breath down spine → "drain" through soles/earth → keep breath rhythmic; stop when baseline returns.
- **Red flags:** Lightheadedness? Sit, hydrate, eat, end session.

### 4.3 **The Eyes of the Dreamer**
- **Purpose:** Stabilize soft, panoramic attention; open perception beyond tunnel focus (waking Dreaming).
- **Procedure:** Soften gaze; widen field; include periphery + body sensations; maintain gentle breath; note without chase.

### 4.4 **Removing the Social Mask**
- **Purpose:** Notice and drop performative tension patterns.
- **Procedure:** Scan face/jaw/throat/shoulders; exhale + let drop; re-scan; repeat.
- **Ethic:** Never pressure others to do this in public spaces. Use in container.

### 4.5 **Aka Dua for Solo Work**
- **Activating the Current:** Intent + touch/breath cue; feel ignition point; keep it simple.
- **Feeling the Aka Dua:** Differentiate current from ordinary sensation by repetition under baseline conditions.
- **Moving the Aka Dua:** Sweep through limbs/torso/spine; avoid forcing; follow ease.
- **Mudra for Charging:** Use the manual’s mudra; hold lightly; observe charge without strain.
- **Protection:** Boundary is **clarity and drainage**, not walls. End every session with Draining + Place of Power exit.
- **Aligning with the Cosmos -- Sun Salutations:** Optional physical sequence to warm the system and align breath/flow.

### 4.6 **Work with Others**
- **Circulation Exercise:** Sit/stand; sender/receiver roles; circulate the current in a loop; maintain breath and consent.
- **Sending the Aka Dua Energy:** Sender aligns → minimal intent ("for your highest integration") → gentle stream → check-in.
- **Releasing Excess Energy:** Receiver uses Draining + movement if needed; never trap charge.
- **Applications:** Emotional calming, focus, post-stress decompression, creative activation, sleep support (receiver’s intent leads).

---

## 5) Safety & Ethics (non-negotiables)
- **Consent:** Explicit, specific, revocable. No "silent treatment" sending.
- **Scope:** Aka Dua is complementary. It is **not** a medical or psychological treatment.
- **Aftercare:** Hydration, food, feet-on-floor, brief debrief (what was felt, what helped, what to change).
- **Boundaries:** No energy "fixing" of others’ patterns. Offer current; let their system integrate or decline.
- **Stop conditions:** Dizziness, numbness, panic, dissociation → end session, drain, ground.

---

## 6) Vibrational Sub-Bands (index stub)
The manual mentions a **range of Aka Dua vibrational frequencies**. Capture them **verbatim** from your copy and list them here as you formalize your catalog.

- **TODO:** Transcribe exact sub-band names/qualities from aka-dua-2.pdf § _Range of Aka Dua Vibrational Frequencies_.
- **Usage pattern:** Choose 1 sub-band per session until discrimination is stable. Don’t stack until repeatable.
