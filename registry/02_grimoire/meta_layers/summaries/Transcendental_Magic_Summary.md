# Transcendental Magic -- Summary (Éliphas Lévi)

## One Breath
Lévi’s "Dogme et Rituel" unites Kabbalah, Tarot, and ceremonial practice into a formula: **Magic = Will + Imagination acting on the Astral Light**. Doctrine = metaphysics; Ritual = applied tools.

## Core Pillars
- **Astral Light**: Subtle medium storing & transmitting forms.
- **Will + Imagination**: The true wand & cup; balanced they imprint reality.
- **Baphomet**: Reconciliation of opposites (solve/coagula).
- **Pentagram & Hexagram**: Microcosm vs. macrocosm harmonics.
- **Tarot**: Initiatory map of Tree of Life.
- **Magical Chain**: How thought–emotion–image form influence loops.
- **Great Work**: Self-equilibration before mediating worlds.

## Ritual Kit
Wand (Will), Cup (Imagination), Sword (Discernment), Pentacle (Anchoring), Circle, Triangle, Names & Sigils, Banishing & Consecration.

## Initiatory Arc
1. Know  
2. Dare  
3. Will  
4. Keep Silent  

## TL;DR
**Balanced Will + Imagination imprint the Astral Light through symbol and rite--ethics keep it clean.**
