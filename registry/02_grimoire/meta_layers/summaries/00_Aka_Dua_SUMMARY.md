# 00 -- Aka Dua (SUMMARY)

**Source:** `aka-dua-2.pdf` (Koyote the Blind).  
**Use:** internal practitioner notes (mythopoetic framing, not public-facing).

## What it is (non-fluff, practitioner lens)
- An initiatic **energy current** with **distinct vibrational bands** (Level I–III) and practical techniques.
- Toltec stream with diaspora mythos (Ce Acatl, exile, transmission cells).
- Focus on **self-regulation**, **energy hygiene**, and **directed application** (solo + with others).

## Key mechanics we actually use
- **Activation & Sensation mapping:** hands → body scan → locus anchoring.
- **Draining** + **Place of Power** setup; **Circulation** with partner.
- **Modalities (bands):** use as *modes*, not lore--tag by effect (e.g., "solarizing / tonic", "centring", "penetrative focus", "enveloping field").

## Boundaries (how we talk about it in the book/games)
- No attunement claims, no lineage promises. We **fictionalize language** (mythopoetic veneer) but keep **procedural clarity**.
- Echoed as **AKA-D field** in lore; **SR0**/Egyptian corollary is *vibe*, not doctrine.

## Bridges to the Codex
- **Reiki Systems Codex:** list "Aka Dua" as **closed practitioner system** (internal use), with cross-refs to **Elemental correspondences** when relevant.
- **Archetype Codex:** map bands ↔ archetypal stances (e.g., Lion, Serpent, Sun, Night).

## Hooks into story/game systems
- **Mechanic tag:** `aka_dua.band` (string) + `aka_dua.state` (enum: idle/primed/flow/ground).
- **Scene prompt:** before ritual scene → "prime: Place of Power + Draining", exit → "Ground + circulatory wash".
