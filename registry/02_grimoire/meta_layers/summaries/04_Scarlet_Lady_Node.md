# Node: The Scarlet Lady (Babalon Current)

## Essence
Ecstatic devotion through form. The cup that receives All. She dissolves shame and turns desire into sacrament.

## Mechanics
- **Overflow Resource:** Joy/Lust meter fuels miracles; spend it to cleanse or charm.
- **Vow of Openness:** Saying "yes" to what is → debuffs fear.

## Ritual Cue
Touch cup to heart, breathe "All is holy," release exhale through lips.

## Cross-refs
- **Lévi** (union of opposites), **Quan Yin/Violet Flame** (compassion transmutation).
