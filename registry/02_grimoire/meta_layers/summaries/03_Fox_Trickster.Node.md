# Node: The Fox (Trickster Engineer)

## Essence
Clever, slippery, boundary-crossing. Breaker of traps; setter of better ones. Patron of puzzles and elegant scams that free stuck energy.

## Mechanics
- **Misdirection:** NPC doubles, mirror text, swapped doors.
- **Trade of Equal Delight:** Fox takes something but leaves a boon (players feel tricked yet rewarded).
- **Footprints Backwards:** Clues point opposite; solution is the other way.

## Ritual Cue
Thin smile, three taps, whisper "Not this way" -- then go that way.

## Cross-refs
- **Book of Lies**, **White Rabbit** (lure), **Morgan** (glamour).
