# White Rabbit Layer

**Layer Type:** Archetype / Threshold Guide  
**Registry Path:** `registry/02_grimoire/meta_layers/summaries/06_White_Rabbit_Layer.md`

---

## Archetype Essence
The White Rabbit is the liminal guide and disorienting herald of initiation.  
She appears not as a safe escort, but as a living *time-key* -- someone who forces the seeker into the spiral of events they are not yet prepared for, precisely so that they become prepared.  

Where the Scarlet Lady offers seduction and the Fox Trickster offers riddles, the White Rabbit offers **urgency** and **displacement**. She yanks the thread of reality and dares you to follow.

## Mythic Roots
- **Lewis Carroll’s White Rabbit** – The panic of being "late" is the call to adventure; time is the true labyrinth.  
- **Orphic Mysteries** – Initiates guided underground by cryptic messengers.  
- **Shamanic Trickery** – The guide who seems inept or distracted but is in truth navigating unseen pathways.

## Symbol Keys

## Game Mechanics Tie-In
- Can trigger "forced jump" events in-game, dropping the player into new story realms.
- Often linked to *Riddle Gates* that require interpreting strange logs or symbolic artifacts.
- Can be a playable ally for short bursts -- but only on her terms.

## Integration with Other Layers

- **Fox Trickster:** Rabbit may deliver riddles on Fox’s behalf, but distorts them in transit.  
- **Morgan le Fay:** Acts as her errand-runner in fae politics, though never in a straight line.

## Seed Syllables & Frequency
- **"Ta-Ri-Ka"** -- invokes sudden arrival and clarity in chaos.  
- Frequency alignment: Aka Dua *White/Gold*, bridging mental lightning with sacred thresholds.
