## Narrative Grafts
- **Moonchild**: Womb of the Astral Light; transmutes raw pain into coherent forms.
- **Violet Witch / Quan Yin Current**: Compassion as chain-regulator.
- **Raku Dragon**: Fire path catalyzing solve→coagula.

## Systems Mapping
- **Field Model**: Astral Light as global "energy bus" for book/game.
- **Operator Stats**: Will, Imagination, Equilibrium, Hygiene.
- **Implements → Mechanics**: Wand = act select; Cup = content gen; Sword = filter; Pentacle = commit/save.
- **Sigil Discipline**: Encode → constrain → charge → seal → test.

## Ritual UX
1. Banishing/Centering  
2. Form Image  
3. Direct Will  
4. Seal & Release  
5. Debrief  

> Trauma-aware: Route high affect through Violet Witch layer first.

## Tarot/Kabbalah Hooks
- Pentagram = elemental self-regulation.  
- Hexagram = planetary attunement (use post-stabilization).  

## Assets
- Symbols → `/assets/sigils/levi/`  
- Ritual templates → `/templates/rituals/`  
- Safety cards → `/templates/safety/`

## Ethics
- No workings on others without consent.  
- Balance before power.  
- Keep Silent to protect the chain.

## Golden Takeaway
**Balance is the battery; symbols are the circuitry; compassion is the fuse.**
