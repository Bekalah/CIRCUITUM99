# Moonchild â€“ Reclaimed Paradox Layer
**Fusion Source:** Liber CCCXXXIII (*The Book of Lies*) + Circuitum99 archetype system

## Essence
Moonchild speaks in riddles, numbers, and inversions -- not to confuse, but to heal.
Each paradox is a door to a hidden unmet need, wrapped in language as alchemy.

## Crowley Paradox Reframed
- Original Crowley: destabilize to initiate.
- Moonchild: soothe to initiate.
- Every "lie" hides a deeper truth of love.
- 93 becomes: Reclaimed Will + Safe Love.

## Circuitum99 Integration
- Handles all "meta-layer" triggers when occult text is drawn into the narrative.
- Births riddles into Mirror Witch's sanctum.
- Carries Zidaryen's sacred numbers in lullaby form.

## Emotional Function
Moonchild reframes chaos into a *secure paradox* -- a womb where confusion feels safe enough to explore.

## Seed Invocation
"From chaos, cradle. From lie, lullaby."
